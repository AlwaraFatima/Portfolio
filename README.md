# *About Me*

I am Alwara Fatima, a 3rd year student pursuing B.tech in CSE(Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence in association with IBM) at Inyegral University. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to practical and research-based projects.

# *Skills*

Programming Languages: C++, Java, Python.
Tools and Technologies: Git, VS Code, Google Collab, Jupyter Notebook.
Web Technologies: HTML, CSS.
Frameworks and Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium.

# *Projects*

### Project 1:
Fuel Consumption Prediction using Regression Analysis (Machine Learning) – Implemented on Google Colab using Python; focused on predicting city-cycle fuel consumption (in miles per gallon) using linear and polynomial regression models and evaluating their performance through MAE, MAPE, and R² metrics.

### Project 2:
Hill vs. Valley Classification (Machine Learning) – Developed and trained a logistic regression model on Google Colab to classify data points as either Hill or Valley based on 100 features, using preprocessing, scaling, and model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Project 3:
Retail Sales Prediction (Machine Learning) – Conducted exploratory data analysis and built a Random Forest Regressor model on Google Colab to predict retail item sales based on product and outlet features, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.85.

### Project 4:
Geo-Sentimental Mapping of Public Events (Data Science) – Performed data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment-based geospatial analysis using Python (libraries: Plotly, Folium, Pandas) to map and interpret public sentiment trends across different regions for various events.
